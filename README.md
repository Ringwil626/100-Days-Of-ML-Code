# 100 Days Of ML Code

My attempt at solving [100 Days Of ML Code](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code).

## ##EDIT##

I have stopped to follow it because the course isn't complete, as it lacks a lot of the infographics needed to understand the material at the moment.
Also, the exemple code is lacking explaination / parts are missing in the original repo, so it is pretty hard to follow.
